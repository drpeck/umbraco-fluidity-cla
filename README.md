# Umbraco Fluidity - Contributor License Agreement

The purpose of this repository is to seek retrospective signing of a CLA for past contributors to the Fluidity project. For Umbraco v8, in order to make the Fluidity project maintainable we are looking to move to a commercial + "source available" licensing approach where use of the product will require a paid for license file, but we will look to keep the vast majority of the source code available so that developers can still contribute or build custom solutions where required.

Due to this change however, it will mean a change in license from Apache 2.0 to a "source available" licensing strategy (exact license is TBC). As past contributors though, the copyright of those contributions has only been licensed to the Fluidity project under the same Apache 2.0 license and so approval to grant Matt Brailsford & Outfield Digital Ltd an unrestricted copyright license is required to be able to make this licensing change.

## How to sign

This page will contain a list of people who have made source code contributions to the Fluidity project where that contribution is still present in the v8 codebase. To sign the agreement, we request developers make a pull request against this [README](README.md) file, checking off their name from the list below and submitting this change as a PR. During the PR process we will use [cla-assistant.io](https://cla-assistant.io/) to capture your approval of the CLA.
